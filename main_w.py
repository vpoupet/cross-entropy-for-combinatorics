# Code to accompany the paper "Constructions in combinatorics via neural networks and LP solvers" by A Z Wagner
# Code template
#
# This code works on tensorflow version 1.14.0 and python version 3.6.3
#
# For later versions of tensorflow there seems to be a massive overhead in the predict function for some reason, and/or it produces mysterious errors.
# If the code doesn't work, make sure you are using these versions of tf and python.
#
# I used keras version 2.3.1, not sure if this is important, but I recommend this just to be safe.

#Use this file as a template if you are able to use numba njit() for the calc_score function in your problem.
#Otherwise, if this is not an option, modify the simpler code in the *demos* folder
